# Fourier_Series_Animation
This project is a simple animation of Fourier series, approximating a function using a sum of sine and cosine functions. Fourier series is a fundamental tool in signal analysis. Using NumPy and Matplotlib libraries in Python, this project animates the changes in the function as the number of Fourier series components increases.
